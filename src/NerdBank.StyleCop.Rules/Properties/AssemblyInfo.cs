// Uncomment this line to build a partially trusted assembly.
// This has some security bonuses in that if there was a way to
// hijack this assembly to do something it is not designed to do,
// it will fail before doing much damage.
// But a partially trusted assembly's events, handled by the hosting
// web site, will also be under the partial trust restriction.
// Also note that http://support.microsoft.com/kb/839300 states a 
// strong-name signed assembly must use AllowPartiallyTrustedCallers 
// to be called from a web page, but defining PARTIAL_TRUST below also
// accomplishes this.
////#define PARTIAL_TRUST

// We DON'T put an AssemblyVersionAttribute in here because it is generated in the build.
